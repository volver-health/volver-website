# At Volver Health, we’re on a mission.

For Hispanics and Latinx folks in the United States, the significant barriers to accessing, and low engagement with, substance abuse treatment and recovery resources is shameful.

This unmet need constitutes a damaging and hidden burden on the health and well-being of an estimated 30 million people.

# The barriers are many.

Limited resources, cultural and institutional factors, perceived treatment efficacy, language, and logistics to name a few. Moreover, stigma and perceived lack of family support have been identified as significant barriers.

When experiencing challenges related to their alcohol and substance use, Hispanos often simply don’t know where to turn for help – they may be wary of the consequences of seeking help, they may doubt their problems will be understood, and they may not feel that the treatment or resources available are appropriate for their worldview or values.

# We want to smash the walls.

At Volver Health, we develop technology solutions to directly confront this inequity. We seek to leverage the strengths and available resources of our community – and empower Hispanic and Latinx folks to get the treatment they deserve, in a relevant and culturally-appropriate manner.
